## INSTAGRAM DOWNLOADER

Use it to download images of a user.

Usage 

``` 
  $ python insta.py USERNAME

```

replace USERNAME with the persons username/handle. Script will take care of the rest.
It will download images in a separate folder named by username in the `/` directory.


### TODO
1. Improve downloading module. Multithreading can be used.
1. User preferable resolution.
1. let choose the download format => `jpg` or `png`
1. let download only the popular images
1. let download all images
1. let only download the new ones like top 20 or so
1. save the urls to a file to batch download with likes of IDM
1. Eventually make this downloader a class, since handling this all will be cumbersome soon
1. Let people download tags
